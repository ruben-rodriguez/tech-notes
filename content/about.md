My name is Ruben and I'm a geeky tech samurai obsessed with computers and such.
You can learn more about me on my personal site which holds my resume: [Resume](https://ruben-rodriguez.github.io)
I also write posts (in spanish) with my wife at [Akiyosen Blog](https://blog.akiyosen.net)

This site serves as a note repository on how to perform random things related with my interests:
- Systems Operations & Administration (GNU/Linux)
- Scripting (python, bash, zsh and fish)
- DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, git, etc
- Container related technologies: Kubernetes, Docker, containerd, etc
- Virtualization

I might also publish some links to my public repositories hosted on GitHub: [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/ruben-rodriguez)
